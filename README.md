# Wide-and-Deep-Keras
Keras implementation of Tensorflow's Wide and Deep Algorithm

This is just a quick, fun excercise trying to replicate Tensorflow's Wide and Deep Algorithm [wide and deep](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/wide_and_deep) in Keras using the functional [API](https://keras.io/getting-started/functional-api-guide/).
